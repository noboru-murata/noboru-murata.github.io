                <p>Biological system can be regarded as a high-dimensional dynamical
system with a complex structure.  There are only a few variables
that can be observed externally in an uncertain and noisy
environment.  In many cases, there is a large discrepancy between
what we want to know and what we can measure.</p>

<h2 id="estimating-neural-connectivity-from-spike-trains">Estimating Neural Connectivity from Spike Trains</h2>
<p>Estimating neural connections is a fundamental problem in order to
understand functions of biological systems and learning
mechanisms.  Although electrode recording is a rather classical
tool, recent development allows us to measure activities of
multiple neurons simultaneously and continuously.  For multiple
spike train analysis, we propose a method to solve</p>
<ul>
<li>pseudo correlation caused by higher-order effect,</li>
<li>influence from unobserved neurons,</li>
<li>directional excitatory/inhibitory connections.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="biologically-inspired-image-super-resolution">Biologically Inspired Image Super-Resolution</h2>
<p>It is said that the microsaccade (fixation micro-motion of our
eyeballs) has various functions, and one of them is to acquire
super-resolution information by causing misalignment in the acquired
images.  Based on this idea, we proposed an algorithm for
super-resolution by aligning small regions (patches) of several
consecutive images, and decomposing a low-resolution image and
recombining a high-resolution image in each patch by sparse coding.</p>
