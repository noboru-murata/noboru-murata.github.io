<p>Plasticity is one of the most important properties of the nervous
system, which enables animals to adjust their behavior to the
ever-changing external environment. Changes in synaptic efficacy
between neurons constitute one of the major mechanisms of
plasticity. Therefore, estimation of neural connections is crucial
for investigating information processing in the brain. Although
many analysis methods have been proposed for this purpose, most of
them suffer from one or all the following mathematical
difficulties: (1) only partially observed neural activity is
available; (2) correlations can include both direct and indirect
pseudo-interactions; and (3) biological evidence that a neuron
typically has only one type of connection (excitatory or
inhibitory) should be considered. To overcome these difficulties, a
novel probabilistic framework for estimating neural connections
from partially observed spikes is proposed in this paper. First,
based on the property of a sum of random variables, the proposed
method estimates the influence of unobserved neurons on observed
neurons and extracts only the correlations among observed
neurons. Second, the relationship between pseudo-correlations and
target connections is modeled by neural propagation in a
multiplicative manner. Third, a novel information-theoretic
framework is proposed for estimating neuron types. The proposed
method was validated using spike data generated by artificial
neural networks. In addition, it was applied to multi-unit data
recorded from the CA1 area of a ratâ€™s hippocampus. The results
confirmed that our estimates are consistent with previous
reports. These findings indicate that the proposed method is useful
for extracting crucial interactions in neural signals as well as in
other multi-probed point process data.</p>
